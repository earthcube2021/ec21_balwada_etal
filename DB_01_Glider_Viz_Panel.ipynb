    "## Purpose\n",
    "Many oceanographic observational platforms, such as gliders, Argo floats, or ships, collect measurements on complex spatio-temporal paths. These sampling patterns are sometimes determined by logistical choices, e.g. due to weather, or sometimes dictated by the underlying oceanic flow causing the platforms to drift around. Deriving insights from these observations is challenging, and researchers almost always need to manually inspect the data. One such manual task might be to distinguish between signals that result due to sampling patterns vs signals that are an actual representation of the environment being studied.\n",
    "For example, a feature drifting by a  stationary platform, which samples the same location repeatedly, might look similar to a slowly evolving feature that a platform traverses through. These distinctions can be made by carefully inspecting the path of the instrument in reference to background measurements, like those from satellites, and this task can be made easier by using interactive visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a workflow for setting up a visualization dashboard to interact with and analyze ocean glider data in combination with other available background measurements (eg. sea surface height, climatology, etc) that might be available in the geographical region sampled by the glider. This interactive visualization dashboard allows for easier data exploration and accelerates the rate at which insights can be derived. The primary purpose of this notebook is  not to simply build a standalone visualization dashboard for our specific data set, but rather provide an example that can be easily adapted to the specific use cases that individual researchers might have.\n",
    "\n",
    "We visualize data for a particular glider campaign that was conducted in the Southern Ocean from May to August 2019, where two SeaGliders sampled the top 1000m of the ocean water column (a profile every 4 hours) in close proximity to each other. Sea Surface Height (SSH) and Finite Size Lypunov Exponents (FSLE, a measure of strain in the flow) are available from satellite based measurements and help provide background context in the sampling region. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical contributions\n",
    "The main technical contributions of this notebook are as follows:\n",
    "- demonstrates how [GliderTools](https://glidertools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in combination with Scipy interpolation routines can be used to grid data collected by gliders, which is stored as point measurements.\n",
    "- demonstrates how [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) and the [Holoviz](https://holoviz.org/) visualization ecosystem, such as panel, hvplot, geoviews etc, can be used in combination to easily setup an interactive visualization tool to analyze glider data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "The glider data is a collection of point measurements in space and time, where each measured variable has an associated position (longitude, latitude, depth) and time stamp. The glider data can be loaded and quality controlled using [GliderTools](https://glidertools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For making visualization easy and more interpretable this data is first gridded onto two regular grids; one is a time vs depth grid (T-grid) and the other other is an along track distance vs depth grid (D-grid). The T-grid helps visualize the duration of time over which different signals are observed, while the D-grid helps visualize the spatial size of the objects in the platform following coordinate. The gridding also helps colocate variables that might be slightly offset due to the different sampling frequencies of different sensors.  This gridded data set is then visualized along with the SSH and FSLE data sets, which are already available on a uniform grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization dashboard has three main parts. The first part is a set of widgets that allow the user to make choices, such as selecting which variable to plot, the range of time or distance, choice of colormaps etc. The second part is a spatial plot of the surface properties (SSH or FSLE) with the glider tracks overlaid on it, where the selected glider and time slice to plot are based on the widgets. The third part is a plot of the glider section, where the exact range of time or distances plotted and the variables plotted are based on the variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization is made possible using the [Holoviz](https://holoviz.org/) libraries. Each widget selection sets the value of a certain parameter using the [param](https://param.holoviz.org/index.html) library, where parameters could be the variable to plot, the choice of colormap, etc. The plots are made possible using the libraries like [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/), [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/), or [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org/). The parameter values are relayed to the plots using [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/), which also controls of the layout of the different components and manages the updates when interactions take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "The main purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how a dashboard to explore glider data can be built using open source packages. The code is demonstrated in detail below and will hopefully serve as a useful example for others to explore their own datasets. The final cell of the notebook should result in dashboard that can be displayed in a notebook cell or in a standalone browser window. Some of the features of this dashboard are showcased in the gif below. The dashboard can also be accessed directly, without running all the cells in this notebook, by using the link to the 'Binder panel' in the repo readme; this makes the dashboard particularly appealing for sharing with collaborators that do not want to run the code.\n",

    "## Suggested next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- We recommend that readers try to adapt this dashboard for their own datasets! \n",
    "- To generalize the current dashboard code to use with additional datasets, it would be useful to add an option to read remote web-optimized formats instead of storing preprocessed netcdf datasets with the dashboard code. \n",
    "- A few possible (non-essential) user experience improvements were identified (see wishlist on https://github.com/dhruvbalwada/glider-panel-demo), which can incorporated in future releases.\n",
